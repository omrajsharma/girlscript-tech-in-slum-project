<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
üí°Ô∏è **Going ahead with our mission of #EducationFirst, we want each and every educationally backward children in urban slums to come under the safety net of education through an innovative approach.**

We, at GirlScript hope to solve the massive social problems associated with education of less fortunate children, for whom quality education is still a distant dream.

Education is the only weapon that can improve an individual‚Äôs chances in life and helps to tackle poverty. 

We have successfully taught 100+ Slum kids through this initiative. 
We are aiming to expand the project to other parts of the country as well so that everyone can get access to quality education.

_Why children living in Slums can't dream of a corporate job? Why should they always imagine being a house help?
We started #TechInSlums by GirlScript Foundation last year at Shahbad Dairy location by Child Rights and You (CRY) in Delhi.
First challenge was curriculum as we wanted the overall development of the students.
The next challenge was Covid19 as these children do not have laptops/mobile or internet access.
We not only formed a curriculum with tech and employability skills but we also managed to get these children laptops, internet access and remote learning! Nobody could even imagine it.
These children have learned to build websites, content generation, designing, writing emails, building chatbots and much more._
